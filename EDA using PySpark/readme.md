**Stats Canada Employment EDA**
**Overview**
This project involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on employment statistics in Canada using PySpark. The dataset provides detailed employment data segmented by various age groups and gender, offering insights into employment trends over time.

**Importance**
Understanding employment trends is crucial for policymakers, economists, and businesses to make informed decisions. This analysis helps identify patterns, anomalies, and significant changes in employment, which can inform strategies for economic development and workforce planning.

**Key Findings**
Unique Age Groups: The dataset includes 22 distinct age groups, providing a comprehensive view of employment across different demographics.
Average Employment Value: The average employment value varies significantly across age groups, with "15 years and over" having the highest average employment value.
Employment Rate by Gender: Employment rates differ between genders, with detailed analysis showing variations across different age groups.
Employment Trends Over Time: Employment values fluctuate over time, with notable changes observed between consecutive months.
Employment Value for Specific Age Groups: Detailed analysis of employment values for age groups like "15 years and over" and "25 to 44 years" reveals trends and patterns over the months.
Significant Changes: Identifying significant changes in employment values between consecutive months helps understand the impact of seasonal variations and economic factors.

*Conclusion*
This project provides valuable insights into employment statistics in Canada, highlighting trends and patterns that are essential for effective economic planning and policy-making. The use of PySpark ensures efficient handling and analysis of large datasets, making this project a robust tool for employment analysis.

**Problem:** We store files on your local device and process them using languages like R and Python. However, local workstations are limited and cannot handle massive datasets. 
**Solution:** **Distributed processing** is a setup in which multiple processors are used to run an application. Instead of processing large datasets on a single computer, the task can be divided between various devices that communicate 

**What is Apache Spark?**

Apache Spark is a distributed processing system for big data and machine learning tasks on large datasets. It enables users to run queries and workflows on petabytes of data, outperforming previous engines like Hadoop. Major companies like IBM, Amazon, and Yahoo use Apache Spark.

**What is PySpark?**

PySpark is the Python interface for Apache Spark. It allows users to write Python and SQL-like commands to manipulate and analyze data in a distributed environment. Data scientists use PySpark to manage data, build machine learning pipelines, and tune models.

**Why Use PySpark?**
1. Speed: PySpark processes big data faster than Pandas and Dask, handling petabytes of data efficiently.
2. Real-time Data: Unlike Hadoop's batch processing, PySpark can handle real-time data collection.
3. Community Support: Spark has better community support and reliability compared to Apache Flink.
4. Fault Tolerance: PySpark can recover from failures and supports in-memory computation, running even without a hard drive or SSD.
